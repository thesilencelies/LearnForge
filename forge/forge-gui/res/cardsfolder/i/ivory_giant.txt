Oracle:When Ivory Giant enters the battlefield, tap all nonwhite creatures.\nSuspend 5- {W} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {W} and exile it with five time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
