Oracle:Suspend 4- {1}{R} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, pay {1}{R} and exile it with four time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)\nEach player discards his or her hand, then draws seven cards.
