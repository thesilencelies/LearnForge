Oracle:When Nantuko Shaman enters the battlefield, if you control no tapped lands, draw a card.\nSuspend 1- {2}{G}{G} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{G}{G} and exile it with a time counter on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
