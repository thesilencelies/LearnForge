# The following doesn't work in certain cases (mass removal) and probably corner cases (maybe such as Kodama controlled by someone else rather than its owner), but doesn't crash Forge
# and works in all basic cases (Kodama dying in combat or to a direct damage spell, for instance). Y=X+1 logic is used to account for Kodama itself (see the 2/1/2005 ruling: X is always
# at least 1).
