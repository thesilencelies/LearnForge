Oracle:Until your next turn, creatures can't attack you. Exile Chronomantic Escape with three time counters on it.\nSuspend 3- {2}{W} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{W} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)
