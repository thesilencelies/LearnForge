Name=Snowscape
Description=Grab your mittens and a shovel, because it's hip-deep in snow in here! With the "Snowscape" deck, you'll harness the powerful magic of the ice to freeze out your opponents. The deck is filled with snow permanents and cards that get more powerful with snow permanents around. Get a few of them working together, and the cold won't be the only reason your opponent will be shivering.
