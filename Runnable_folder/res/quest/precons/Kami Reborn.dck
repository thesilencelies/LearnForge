Name=Kami Reborn
Description=The spirits of Kamigawa practice their own form of magic, and the "Kami Reborn" deck puts it at your fingertips. Many of the creatures have "spiritcraft" abilities that do something whenever you play a Spirit or Arcane spell. For example, Soilshaper turns a land into a 3/3 creature until end of turn and Thief of Hope steals 1 life from your opponent. Of course, all but a handful of your spells are Spirits or Arcane.
