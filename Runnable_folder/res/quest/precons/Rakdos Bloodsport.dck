Name=Rakdos Bloodsport
Description=The Cult of Rakdos is the most dangerous and reckless guild in all of Ravnica. With the "Rakdos Bloodsport" deck, you’ll need to adopt some of that mentality yourself. The guild's mechanic - hellbent - rewards you for having no cards in your hand, a behavior that makes "careful" players cringe. But you must trust in the minions of Rakdos, throwing caution to the wind!
