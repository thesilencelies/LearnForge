Name=Path of Blight
Description=Like any aggressive green-white deck, the "Path of Blight" deck deploys cheap creatures to the table and then uses combat tricks to ensure that your cards trump theirs. The difference is that since all your creatures have infect, they need to deal only 10 damage to your opponent to ensure your victory!
