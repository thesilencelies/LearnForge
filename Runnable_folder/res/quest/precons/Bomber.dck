Name=Bomber
Description=Fly the friendly skies? Your opponent will think twice about that after facing the "Bomber" deck. You'll take control of the game with tricky blue spells and Wizards, and then your big flying creatures will really deliver a beating. You won't always attack much in the beginning of the game, but by the end, you'll be on top of the world.
