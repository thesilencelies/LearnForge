Name=Mortal Coil
Description=Like to exploit weakness? Then grab the "Mortal Coil" deck! This deck focuses on tricks you can pull with -1/-1 counters. Of course, the most basic "trick" is simply to put them on your opponent's creatures, which Grim Poppet, Torture, and Incremental Blight do with ease. But you're cleverer than that!
Deck Type=constructed
Set=SHM
