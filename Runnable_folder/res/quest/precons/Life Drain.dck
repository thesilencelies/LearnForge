Name=Life Drain
Description=Got a lust for life? Then the "Life Drain" deck is right up your alley! This deck is stuffed with cards that boost your life total, like Recumbent Bliss and Apothecary Initiate. Even better, some of its cards increase your life at your opponent's expense! For example, you'll gain life from the lifelink ability of Voracious Hatchling whenever it deals damage, and Syphon Life lowers your opponent's life as it raises yours.
