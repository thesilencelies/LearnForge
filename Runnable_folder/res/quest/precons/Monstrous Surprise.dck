Description=The scariest thing a monster can do is not stay dead. That's exactly how the creatures in the "Monstrous Surprise" deck behave. When any creature with the undying ability dies, if it didn't have a +1/+1 counter on it, it returns from the graveyard to the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it.
