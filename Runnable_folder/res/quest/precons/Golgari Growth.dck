Name=Golgari Growth
Description=The Golgari don't discriminate based on paltry factors like whether a creature is alive. Any warm - or cold - body will do the job. That's why the scavenge mechanic is so powerful: when you put that card's power back on the battlefield in the form of +1/+1 counters, it's like the creature never died at all!
